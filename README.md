# Simple Calculator

## Description

The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript by building a fully functioning calculator within a styled webpage.
I learned about attributes and applying them to my HTML for both CSS and JavaScript files seperately.



## Usage

Basic computations can be acheived via a user friendly interface.

## Credits

For this project I fully followed along with a content creator and web developer on Youtube.
